# Products Database Creation
Due: September 12th by Classtime.

## Overview

This assignment is about creating a products database representing data found in [allProducts.json](../../walmart_data/allProducts.json). 

There will be (as of now) four tables:

- gift_options
- image_entities
- market_place_price
- products

You should use the sql files located in this folder to build your schema but you must first alter the table create statements 
to include the proper datatypes. 

I've created a file called [keys.json](./keys.json) that holds each `column name` along with its data type and max size. This was created using php so the data types aren't 1=>1 with sql.
