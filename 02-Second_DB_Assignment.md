## First Assignment

#### Part 2 Due: Wednesday September 2nd by Midnight

### Description

Now that your table is created and sitting there in your database, it's time to load it with data. You saw many of the 
possible errors in class when we don't choose the correct data types for columns. Make sure you adjust your tables accordingly
so that the data received from `api.randomusers.me` will fit correctly. 

Look at the php_mysqli_intro.md

```json
{
  results: [{
    user: {
      gender: "female",
      name: {
        title: "ms",
        first: "manuela",
        last: "velasco"
      },
      location: {
        street: "1969 calle de alberto aguilera",
        city: "la coruÃ±a",
        state: "asturias",
        zip: "56298"
      },
      email: "manuela.velasco50@example.com",
      username: "heavybutterfly920",
      password: "enterprise",
      salt: ">egEn6YsO",
      md5: "2dd1894ea9d19bf5479992da95713a3a",
      sha1: "ba230bc400723f470b68e9609ab7d0e6cf123b59",
      sha256: "f4f52bf8c5ad7fc759d1d4156b25a4c7b3d1e2eec6c92d80e508aa0b7946d4ba",
      registered: "1303647245",
      dob: "415458547",
      phone: "994-131-106",
      cell: "626-695-164",
      DNI: "52434048-I",
      picture: {
        large: "http://api.randomuser.me/portraits/women/39.jpg",
        medium: "http://api.randomuser.me/portraits/med/women/39.jpg",
        thumbnail: "http://api.randomuser.me/portraits/thumb/women/39.jpg",
      },
      version: "0.6"
      nationality: "ES"
    },
    seed: "graywolf"
  }]
}
```

I want your table to have the following columns:

```
  gender
  title
  first
  last
  street
  city
  state
  zip
  email
  username
  password
  dob
  phone
  picture 
```
