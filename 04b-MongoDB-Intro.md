### What is MongoDB?

> MongoDB (from "humongous") is a scalable, high-performance, open source NoSQL database.

### Document database

`MongoDB` is a document database, which means that instead of storing "rows" in "tables" like a relational database, "documents" are stored in "collections."  Documents are basically `JSON` objects (technically `BSON`). This is to be distinguished from other NoSQL-type databases such as key-value cache and store (e.g. Redis).

### CRUD

CRUD is an acronym that stands for:  `C`reate, `R`ead, `U`pdate and `D`elete. Below are links to MongoDB's version of CRUD operations. Look through the overviews below. I pulled the images for `document` and `collections` because it's the chosen storage organization that drives Mongo.
